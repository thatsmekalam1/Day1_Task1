# Day1_Task1
#In this task, the data set sales_data.csv was cleaned and preprocessed using Python (Pandas). The data set was initially imported and scanned for missing values, which were then removed using dropna(). There were duplicate rows and they were removed using drop_duplicates(). Categorical text columns such as "Sales_Rep", "Region", etc. were standardized by converting to lowercase, removing leading/trailing whitespaces, and correcting inconsistent labels (e.g., 'Online', 'o', 'ONLINE' mapped to 'online'). Special characters from text columns were also removed using regex. Column "Sale_Date" was standardized to a datetime format (dd-mm-yyyy). Column names were cleaned to lowercase and underscores substituted in some, with others being manually renamed for simplicity. The data types were also checked and confirmed, and column "quantity_sold" force converted to integer. The dataset was then stored as cleaned_sales_data.csv. These actions guarantee the dataset is consistent, legible, and ready for further analysis or visualization.
